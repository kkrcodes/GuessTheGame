# Guess The Movie

<b> Object Oriented Programming in Java (Udacity) - Guess The Movie [Project] </b>

This Java project was done as part of the curriculum of Udacity's Object Oriented Programming in Java course.

Project Summary
---------------
The goal of the project was to build a simple text game where the player gets to guess the movie name given the number of letters in it (pretty much like hangman but with movies). <br>

The rules are simple; the game randomly picks a movie title, and shows the player how many letters it's made up of. The player's goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time. If a letter is indeed in the title the game will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, they lose a point. If they lose 10 points, the game is over.

The project is implemented with the help of two classes:
<ul>
  <li> <b> <i> Game class </i> </b> containing the game logic and methods </li>
  <li> <b> <i> Main class </i> </b> to implement game logic and interact with user. </li>
 </ul>

The text file - <b> "movies.txt" </b> serves the list of movies to be considered for the game.
